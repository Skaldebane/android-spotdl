# android-spotdl
Spotify Downloader is an Android app that downloads Spotify songs and playlists just like the Python tool spotdl (repo spotify-downloader) does.

I saw that the original spotdl tool makes a lot of mistakes when it comes to searching for the right video on YouTube, and I thought of a better approach for that, in addition that everybody will be able to use it in the form of a simple app.

Project files won't be uploaded until more work is done.
